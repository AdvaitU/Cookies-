London’s New Pedestrian-Only Zones: No Cars;  No Bikes;  Just People Walking in Circles	"In a move to create more environmentally friendly spaces in London, the city’s mayor has announced a new series of pedestrian-only zones, where no cars or bicycles will be allowed. However, the plan has quickly spiraled into confusion and frustration, as pedestrians now have nowhere to go except in circles. 'I’m walking in circles around the block,' said one confused commuter. 'I haven’t gotten anywhere in hours.' The new zones, which cover large areas of the city, were designed to reduce emissions, but residents argue they’ve simply replaced one form of traffic with another: the endless traffic of people walking nowhere. Despite the confusion, city officials remain optimistic, claiming that the circular walking spaces will 'promote mental clarity.'"	Percy Trundell	01-Mar	3	3	2	4	1	1	3	1	10	3	1	7	2	4	3	7	2	2	6	4
Tesco Introduces Emotional Support Trolleys Amid Cost-of-Living Crisis	"In a bold move to support Britain’s fraying nerves, Tesco has announced the rollout of Emotional Support Trolleys (ESTs) at selected locations. Equipped with squishy handlebars, Bluetooth speakers emitting whale sounds, and complimentary tissues in the cupholder, these trolleys are designed to help customers remain calm while shopping during economic turbulence. Store Manager, Lorna Beige, explained, ""When cucumbers hit £1.20, we noticed people began weeping in the produce aisle. It was either therapy dogs or these trolleys. Dogs shed. Trolleys don’t."" Shoppers can also select an 'Encouragement Mode' where a softly spoken AI voice offers affirmations like, ""You're budgeting beautifully,"" and, ""Skip the branded cereal — you’re still a good parent."" Critics argue that the funds might have been better used to reduce prices, but Tesco insists the trolleys promote ""mindful consumerism"". Customers surveyed at the Watford branch reported feeling ""20% less existential dread"" when using ESTs, although one pensioner claimed the trolley began singing Gloria Gaynor’s ""I Will Survive"" without warning, scaring her cat. Experts predict other retailers may follow suit. Waitrose is reportedly developing a ‘Hug Aisle’ and Lidl has begun testing helmets that whisper discount codes directly into shoppers’ ears. The government remains tight-lipped, though Chancellor Keith Stanton has been spotted weeping into a bag of own-brand pasta."	Lorna Deepwell	09-Apr	6	1	0	2	3	6	2	1	3	4	7	2	2	4	2	7	2	1	3	1
MP Mistakenly Declares War on Isle of Wight During Pub Quiz	"In what many are calling ""the most British diplomatic blunder of the century,"" Conservative MP Gavin Smugworth accidentally declared war on the Isle of Wight during a pub quiz in Eastleigh on Saturday night. The MP, known for his passionate nationalism and a fondness for real ale, reportedly mistook a trivia question about Napoleonic conflicts as a policy prompt. ""I said we must never surrender Wight again!"" Smugworth defended himself, claiming he thought it referred to a historic naval base, not the sleepy holiday destination. Island council members were initially confused but later retaliated by revoking Smugworth’s honorary ferry pass. ""We’ve always considered ourselves a proud and independent people,"" said Councillor Doris Meeks, who now wants the island to begin minting its own currency, the 'Wighty Pound'. The Prime Minister's office issued a statement urging calm and confirming that, despite Smugworth's pub declarations, the United Kingdom remains in full peace with all internal counties. Meanwhile, Smugworth has been banned from pub quizzes for a month, though he vows to appeal. ""I may have misfired diplomatically, but my knowledge of 80s sitcoms remains unimpeachable,"" he said. Observers note this is not the first time a politician has confused trivia with policy, citing the 2021 incident where a minister attempted to legislate a Monopoly rule change after losing to their nephew."

"MP Spends £10,000 of Public Funds to Install 'Luxury' Garden in Parliamentary Offices"	"In a move that has shocked critics, Conservative MP Rebecca Hawthorne has spent over £10,000 of public funds on creating a lavish garden in her parliamentary office. The project, which includes topiary hedges shaped like the Houses of Parliament, a mini pond with koi fish, and an ornate fountain, has drawn the ire of both taxpayers and political opponents. ""I just wanted to create a peaceful environment for productive policy discussions,"" Hawthorne explained, though many are questioning whether the MP has lost touch with reality. The garden has also sparked controversy over the environmental cost, as it requires 150 litres of water daily and operates a special heating system for the plants during the winter months. ""We’re already facing a climate emergency,"" said Green Party spokesperson Fiona Glisten. ""But I guess we can’t expect much climate awareness from someone who thinks it’s appropriate to add a gazebo next to their desk."" Hawthorne, however, remains unfazed by the criticism. ""It’s the perfect place to brainstorm solutions for the nation's future,"" she said. Meanwhile, the fish have reportedly become more popular than her political speeches, with one koi being offered a role as a cabinet advisor.

Pop Star Bans ‘Out of Tune’ Fans From Her Concerts	"Pop sensation Kiera Storm has announced that fans who sing off-key at her concerts will be banned from attending future shows. In an Instagram post that has since gone viral, Storm, known for her perfect pitch and massive ego, explained that anyone who ""destroys the vibe"" by singing out of tune will be escorted out by security. ""If you can’t keep up with the vocals, don’t even bother showing up,"" she wrote. The announcement has sparked backlash from fans and critics alike, with many accusing the star of elitism and pretentiousness. ""I thought we were here to have fun,"" one disgruntled fan tweeted, adding, ""Is this a concert or a talent show?"" But Storm has stood by her decision, saying that her performances should be ""an experience, not a karaoke session."" Critics argue that her policy could alienate loyal fans who can’t afford voice lessons. Meanwhile, a rival pop star, Stacey Flex, has announced she’ll be offering free vocal coaching for anyone who buys a ticket to her show. "	Cheryl Pink	15-Jun	4	1	3	0	2	4	1	4	0	1	2	0	3	0	5	4	3	4	0	4
"UK Government Announces New 'Buy One, Get One Free' Policy to Combat Inflation"	"In a baffling new economic strategy, the UK government has announced that every time a citizen buys a loaf of bread, they’ll receive a free bag of flour. ""It’s a bold step towards reducing inflation by literally giving things away,"" said Chancellor of the Exchequer Keith Stanton, as he unveiled the policy in a press conference. ""By making everything a buy-one-get-one-free deal, we hope to not only boost consumer spending, but also confuse the hell out of everyone."" Critics have pointed out that the plan doesn't address the root causes of inflation, but the government insists it’s a creative solution. ""If people can’t afford food, at least they’ll get a freebie,"" said Minister of Economic Ideas, Percival Bank. Economists are skeptical, with one going so far as to say, ""The only thing this will stimulate is confusion."" Meanwhile, Tesco has begun offering 'two-for-one' discounts on cat food, causing a 400% rise in pet adoptions nationwide. "	Isla Greengrove	13-May	2	0	3	2	4	1	1	1	3	1	2	3	4	2	3	4	4	4	6	5
"Royal Family Under Scrutiny After Hosting 10,000-Pound ‘Influencer-Only’ Dinner"	"The British royal family is facing intense criticism after hosting a lavish £10,000 dinner for social media influencers in Buckingham Palace. The event, which included custom cocktails named ""The Queen’s Fizz"" and private performances by a hologram of Freddie Mercury, has sparked outrage among taxpayers who are questioning the monarchy’s priorities. ""This is a slap in the face to every Brit struggling to pay their rent,"" said one protester, holding a sign that read, ""Feed the People, Not the Instagrammers."" The palace defended the event, claiming it was part of a ""new outreach program"" designed to connect with younger audiences. However, many are unconvinced. ""This is a PR stunt, nothing more,"" said royal historian Dr. Thomas Whitehead. ""Next, they’ll be inviting TikTok stars to open their Christmas presents live on Instagram."" Meanwhile, some attendees of the dinner took to Instagram to post about their experiences, with one influencer joking, ""Honestly, this feels more like a fantasy novel than real life.""

London’s Newest Subway Line Can’t Be Used Due to 'Artistic Integrity'	"In a shocking new development, London's highly anticipated new subway line, the ""TFL Artistique,"" has been closed indefinitely due to ""artistic integrity"" concerns. The line, which was meant to connect Clapham to Camden, features trains with floors painted to look like abstract expressionist masterpieces and stations that resemble pop-up art galleries. The closure was announced by Transport for London (TfL), who cited an unnamed ""visionary"" artist's refusal to allow anyone to actually use the trains until ""the concept of movement can be truly understood."" ""We need to rethink how we perceive space and time,"" said the artist in a statement released by TfL. ""Until that happens, people must remain grounded."" Commuters were confused and angered. ""I just need to get to work,"" one passenger said, ""but I guess I’ll just meditate until the trains are available."" Critics argue the project is an expensive and unnecessary distraction from the real needs of the city, but TfL insists it is ""redefining urban travel."" Meanwhile, a rival artist is planning a similar project called ""The Abstract Bus"" — where no one is allowed to sit down. "	Marcello Pictura	02-Jun	5	2	0	1	4	0	2	4	3	4	2	0	0	3	2	7	0	0	0	0
New Study Reveals Watching Paint Dry Is Good for Mental Health	"In an astonishing new study, scientists have revealed that watching paint dry can significantly improve mental health. The study, conducted by the Institute of Subtle Pleasures, found that participants who watched a fresh coat of paint dry for 30 minutes reported a 45% decrease in anxiety and an overall sense of well-being. ""There’s something deeply meditative about the gradual process,"" explained Dr. Heather Lysander, who led the research. ""It allows people to unplug, slow down, and reflect in ways they can’t during typical daily distractions."" The findings have sparked an unexpected new trend in wellness. Pop-up ""Drying Paint Zones"" are now being installed in parks, allowing stressed-out Londoners to unwind. Critics of the study, however, argue that the results are too niche, with one skeptic remarking, ""We could have just as easily done a study on staring at clouds or watching grass grow."" Nonetheless, local galleries are now offering paint-drying installations alongside their traditional art exhibits. ""It’s the next big thing,"" said gallery owner Malcolm Finch. ""We’re calling it ‘Art in Motionless Time.’"" "	Leon Ponder	18-Jun	4	5	2	0	1	4	4	0	0	2	1	2	2	3	2	4	1	4	0	3
Exclusive: Government Spends £2 Billion on ‘National Calmness Initiative’	"The UK government has unveiled its latest plan to tackle national anxiety – a £2 billion investment in the “National Calmness Initiative.” The initiative will see therapists stationed at every street corner, meditation sessions broadcast on national television, and an endless supply of lavender-scented candles available to the public. ""The nation’s collective stress levels have skyrocketed in recent years, and we need to address this on a national scale,"" said Health Minister Vanessa Clawson. However, many citizens are questioning the legitimacy of the project. ""I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure a lavender candle is going to fix the housing crisis,"" said one frustrated Londoner. ""And don’t even get me started on the 15-minute compulsory breathing exercises at work."" Critics argue that the money could have been better spent, but the government insists that a calm nation is a productive nation. ""We need to tackle the root causes of stress before we can move forward,"" said Clawson. The initiative will be rolled out later this year, alongside a nationwide “silent disco” movement.

Footballers Refuse to Play Until Conditions Meet New 'Comfortable Pants' Standard	"In an unprecedented move, the Premier League has been thrown into chaos after a group of high-profile footballers announced they would not play until their uniforms meet a new set of ""comfortable pants"" standards.

""We cannot focus on the game if we’re uncomfortable in our own gear,"" said star player Marcus Grant. ""If I’m going to run for 90 minutes, I need pants that support my lifestyle."" The decision comes after a series of complaints from players about uncomfortable shorts and unsupportive undergarments. The league has expressed concerns that the move could lead to a delay in the upcoming season, but players are standing firm. ""This is about our well-being,"" said one unnamed player.

Scientists Warn of Growing Threat of ‘Caffeine Shortages’	"In a bizarre new warning, UK scientists have raised alarms over the growing threat of global caffeine shortages.

Cambridge University Introduces ‘No Exams’ Policy for High-Performing Students	"In a controversial move, Cambridge University has announced a new policy where high-performing students will no longer have to take exams.

""We want to focus on the holistic development of our students,"" said Vice-Chancellor Dr. James Wyndham. ""Exams are too old-fashioned and don’t reflect a student’s true potential."" The policy has been met with mixed reactions. Some students have welcomed the move, with one commenting, ""I’ve been working on my Instagram profile for years, and now it’s finally paying off."" Others have questioned the fairness of the system. ""What about students who aren’t social media influencers?"" asked one concerned academic. ""Will they be penalised?""

Future of ‘Meatless Meat’ Unclear as Scientists Prove It Doesn’t Actually Taste Like Meat	"The future of ""meatless meat"" is in jeopardy after a group of scientists concluded that plant-based meat alternatives do not, in fact, taste like meat. The research, conducted by the University of Oxford, tested a range of meat substitutes and found that none of them replicated the taste or texture of real meat. ""While these alternatives are an admirable attempt, they simply don’t cut it,"" said lead researcher Dr. James Collier. ""The taste is off, and the texture is all wrong."" The findings have sent shockwaves through the plant-based food industry, with some companies already starting to withdraw their meatless products from supermarket shelves. ""This is a huge setback,"" said one industry insider. ""We’ve put all our eggs in the plant-based basket, and now we’ve discovered the basket’s broken.""
